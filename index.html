      <h2> Christmas song "It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like 
         Christmas" [Lyrics]</h2>
         <br>
         <p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, 
            Everywhere you go; Take a look at the five and ten, 
            It's glistening once again
            With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.
         </p>
         <p>
            It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
            Toys in every store, 
            But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be,
            On your own front door.
         </p>
         <p>
            A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
            Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
            Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk, 
            Is the hope of Janice
            and Jen; And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again. 
         </p>
         <p>
            It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
            Everywhere you go; There's a tree in the 
            Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
            It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind
            the snow. 
            It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; Soon the bells will start, 
            And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing, 
            Right within your heart. 
         </p>
