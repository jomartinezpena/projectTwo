# Project 2: What Does Community Mean To You?

### October 23, 2024
By: Johnathan Martinez Pena


## Project Overview:

For this project, I chose this song because it centers around the idea of Christmas and its connection to the community. To me, the community is more than just a group of people, it's the collective joy and experiences that bring us together as a whole. I selected this particular Christmas song because it beautifully captures the essence of community that I feel during the holiday season. To me, "Christmas" isn't just a holiday, but a time when everyone's family, friends, and strangers come together. The Christmas season demonstrates my definition of what community means, as it is a time when individuals from different backgrounds engage in the same traditions while creating a shared experience. The song's lyrics, which talk about holiday traditions like decorating and the joy of children receiving gifts, also resonate strongly with my concept of community. This song reminds me of the shared meals, the gatherings, and the laughter during the Christmas season, which also bring a sense of unity and warmth. By listening to this song, it brings back fond memories of spending time with my family during the holidays.

## Technical Overview:

- Incorporation of festive themes throughout the website to bring the sense of warmth in Christmas, demonstrated through color, and glowing effects given to the text. My choice of Font style for the text captures the sense of "warmth", and a playful vibe.
- Use of transformation skills such as translation, scaling, and skewing in several pages.
- Animated background includes snow falling from the "sky", to influence the sense of winter. 

The coding languages I'm utilizing include: 
- HTML: To structure the website, by including text, and a navigation to the different pages included in the project. 
- CSS: To style the website, including color in text and in background, fonts, layout of the website, transformations, and effects. 

I am using GitHub as the platform for hosting and managing my code. And all included images, and illustrations are edited from Adobe Photoshop.
