# Project 2: What Does Community Mean To You?

### October 14, 2024

## Project Overview:



## Technical Overview:

- Incorporation of festive themes throughout the website to bring the sense of warmth in Christmas, demonstrated through color, and glowing effects given to the text. My choice of Font style for the text captures the sense of "warmth", and a playful vibe.
- Use of transformation skills such as translation, rotation, scaling, and skewing in several pages.

- The coding languages I'm utilizing include HTML and CSS to write the code. 
I am using GitHub as the platform for hosting and managing my code. All included images, and illustrations are edited from Adobe Photoshop.
