# Project 2: What Does Community Mean To You?

### October 14, 2024
By: Johnathan Martinez Pena


## Project Overview:



## Technical Overview:

- Incorporation of festive themes throughout the website to bring the sense of warmth in Christmas, demonstrated through color, and glowing effects given to the text. My choice of Font style for the text captures the sense of "warmth", and a playful vibe.
- Use of transformation skills such as translation, rotation, scaling, and skewing in several pages.

The coding languages I'm utilizing include: 
- HTML: To structure the website, by including text, and a navigation to the different pages included in the project. 
- CSS: To style the website, including color in text and in background, fonts, layout of the website, transformations, and effects. 

I am using GitHub as the platform for hosting and managing my code. And all included images, and illustrations are edited from Adobe Photoshop.
